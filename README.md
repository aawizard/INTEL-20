Opencode'20 Machine Learning

### TASK-1

Task-1 consists of two questions. Both of them require you to apply Linear Regression on a dataset and submit working code and plots. You get separate points for the questions, which means if you complete only the first one, you still get 20 points.

We recommend you use Python 3 as the language and use its libraries - `sci-kit learn` and `matplotlib` to implement the ML model and make plots.

### TASK-2

Task-2 consists of a question related to basic numpy usage. The aim is for it to be an easier alternative to the TASK-1 questions.

### TASK-3

Task-3 is intended to be a challenge and a simulation of a real machine learning problem. it consists of three phases: data cleaning, data preparation, and data analysis. You will also need to pay attention to how you write the code.
